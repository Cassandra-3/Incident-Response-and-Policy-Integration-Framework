## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a **comprehensive Incident Response Framework** for the fictional organization, Canadian Tire Corporation (CTC). It integrates a detailed **Ransomware Incident Response Playbook** with high-level organizational **security policies** to ensure swift, structured, and compliant responses to cybersecurity incidents. The framework minimizes operational disruptions, protects sensitive data, and fosters regulatory compliance.

## **Key Components**

### **1. Ransomware Incident Response Playbook**
The playbook is aligned with the **NIST 7-Step Incident Response Process (PICERL)** and serves as the operational foundation for managing ransomware incidents.

- **Purpose**: Provides actionable steps for detecting, containing, eradicating, and recovering from ransomware threats.
- **Details Include**:
  - **Preparation**: Offline backups, anti-ransomware tools, and regular training.
  - **Detection & Containment**: Indicators of compromise (IoCs), isolation protocols, and sinkholing techniques.
  - **Eradication & Recovery**: Trusted decryption tools, system restoration from backups, and integrity checks.
  - **Post-Incident Review**: Lessons learned and playbook updates for future preparedness.

### **2. Security Policies**
High-level policies support and guide the playbook’s operational aspects.

- **Malware Outbreak Response Policy**: Focuses on rapid containment, eradication, and recovery from ransomware attacks.
- **Data Breach Management Policy**: Mandates timely identification, containment, and notification of stakeholders when Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is compromised.
- **Log Retention and Analysis Policy**: Establishes guidelines for retaining logs for 12 months, weekly reviews, and immediate forensic analysis during incidents.

Each policy outlines **why it’s critical**, the **activities required**, and the **consequences of non-compliance** for both individuals and the organization.

## **Integration and Alignment**

1. **Policy-Playbook Connection**:
   Each policy directly links to the playbook’s actionable steps, aligning strategic objectives with operational execution.
   - Example: The **Malware Outbreak Response Policy** mandates containment procedures detailed in the playbook.

2. **Compliance and Reporting**:
   The framework adheres to **PIPEDA**, PCI DSS, and other regulatory requirements, with escalation and reporting templates for both internal and external stakeholders.

3. **Communication Plan**:
   Internal and external communication strategies ensure stakeholders are informed promptly and accurately during incidents.

## **Benefits of the Framework**

- **Operational Continuity**: Minimizes downtime during ransomware incidents through tested response strategies.
- **Data Protection**: Safeguards sensitive customer and corporate data while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Enhanced Accountability**: Clearly defined roles and responsibilities ensure effective coordination among teams.
- **Proactive Resilience**: Regular updates, simulations, and post-incident reviews maintain the playbook’s relevance and effectiveness.

## **Deliverables**

1. **Incident Response Playbook**: A detailed operational guide following the NIST 7-step process.
2. **Policy Set**: High-level outlines for malware response, data breach management, and log analysis.
3. **Educational Slideshow**: Communicating policies and their importance to employees, ensuring organization-wide awareness and compliance.
